Dear Readers,
Thank you very much for visiting us. I hope, it will give you a head start to Machine Leanring domain and you will learn different techniques of (un/semi)Supervised Learning. 
This is just a basic code to show you how to pre-process data using the seven step define earlier and are follows:

1- Getting the dataset,
2- Importing libraries,
3- Importing datasets,
4- Finding missing data,
5- Encoding categorical data
6- Train/test split
7- Feature scaling

Code scripts (jupyter notebook) in Python programming language are available for for easy learning and coding.

Thanks and keep practicing this code on other (large) datasets which you can download from Kaggle.
